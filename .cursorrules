## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The meditation practice platform implements several interconnected business logic systems:

## Core Business Systems

### Breathwork Visualization Engine
- Implements physiological sigh patterns through particle animation
- Curved trajectory calculations for breathing guidance
- Particle dispersion algorithms for organic movement
Location: src/components/animations/BoomerangAnimation.jsx

### Vibe & Emotional State System
- 10-level emotional state progression tracking
- Practice frequency and duration impact calculations 
- Scientific-backed benefits mapping per state
- Multi-dimensional progress tracking across daily/weekly/monthly periods
Location: mobile-app/services/vibeSystem.js

### Practice Generation System
- Dynamic meditation script generation based on emotional state
- Content adaptation using 5-point emotional scale
- Intelligent practice segmentation by duration
- Narrator pacing controls (120/30 words per minute)
Location: lib/services/ai_practice_generator.dart

### Community Presence Management
- Real-time meditation session tracking
- Shared presence duration metrics
- Three-tier privacy system for community sharing
- Space-specific reflection prompts
Location: src/components/ChatTab.jsx

### Achievement & Progression
- 8-tier achievement tracking system
- Daily reward caps and practice validation
- Monthly progression tiers with unique benefits
- Light points allocation for engagement activities
Location: src/utils/achievements.js

## System Integration Score: 90/100

The business logic creates a cohesive meditation platform centered around emotional state tracking, guided practice generation, and community engagement. The vibe system serves as the core progression mechanic, while breathwork visualization and practice generation provide the primary user value through personalized meditation experiences.
