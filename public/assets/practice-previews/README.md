# Practice Preview Images

This directory contains preview images for practice cards in the Feed.

## Adding Preview Images

1. Create images with these exact filenames:
   - `slow-morning.jpg`
   - `gentle-de-stress.jpg`
   - `take-a-walk.jpg`
   - `draw-your-feels.jpg`
   - `move-and-cool.jpg`
   - `tap-to-ground.jpg`
   - `breathe-to-relax.jpg`
   - `get-in-the-flow-state.jpg`
   - `drift-into-sleep.jpg`

2. Recommended specifications:
   - Format: JPG or PNG
   - Dimensions: 800x1000px (portrait orientation)
   - File size: < 500KB per image
   - Style: Peaceful, meditative imagery matching practice theme

3. Fallback behavior:
   - If an image is missing, a gradient background will be shown
   - Images should represent the mood/theme of each practice

## Generating Images

You can generate AI images using the Animo CLI tool or other AI image generators:

```bash
# Example prompt for "Slow Morning":
"Peaceful morning meditation scene, soft sunrise light, person in quiet contemplation, serene atmosphere, pastel colors"
```

## Current Status

⚠️ This directory is currently empty. Practice cards will use gradient fallbacks until images are added.

To add images quickly, you can:
1. Use AI image generation (Midjourney, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion)
2. Use stock photography (Unsplash, Pexels)
3. Commission custom photography

Once images are added, they will automatically appear on practice cards.
