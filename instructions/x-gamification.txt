You are updating the **magiwork** app’s reward system.

The previous “Aura” system is removed.

We now use **Vibe States represented by animals** to reflect a user’s weekly nervous-system condition.

This prompt defines the **entire Vibe System**, its **UI**, and the **content** you must use across:

1. Main Feed sticky header
2. Results screen (after practice)
3. Profile / History (hamburger menu > profile)
4. Weekly summary (In the profile, on top)
5. Badge assets (emoji placeholders for now, where aura now appears)
6. Microcopy + Benefit explanations

Your job:

Produce **UI/UX specifications** and **content layouts** for all these areas.

Use magiwork brand language:

calm, warm, modern, quiet, friendly, premium.
