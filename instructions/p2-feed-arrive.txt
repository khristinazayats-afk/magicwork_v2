🪞**User state:** Restless, looking for grounding or fun ideas on what to do instead of scrolling.

**Scene feel:** User can scroll through 9 spaces that appear as “portals” with smooth gradients transitions
🪴 *Goal:* Feel invited, not overloaded. Picking a space feels like entering a room, not choosing from a menu.

**UI / UX**

- User lands for the first time, there is blurred screen tip:
    - “There’s a space waiting for you. *Scroll to find the one that fits your moment.”*
- **Interactions**
    - User scrolls out of the hint by scrolling up or down - the first feed space appears - Slow Morning
    - User can scroll vertically through **9 calm spaces** (e.g. *Slow Morning*, *Gentle De-Stress*, *Take a Walk*…) “indefinitely”.
- Each card shows:
    - Subheadline example: “A space to begin the day slowly, side by side.”
    - A warm, pulsing dot: “153 humans here.”
- Scroll: seamless transitions (no abrupt jumps).
  - "Join" button that opens immersive experience view

Header:
- Top bar includes streak count (e.g., "3/30 days of calm") and hamburger menu on the left
