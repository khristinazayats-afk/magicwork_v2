Project Name: magicwork
Tagline: Anxiety off. Presence on.
Goal: Deliver shared calm through immersive sound and connection.

🧘‍♀️ Concept Overview

Build a minimalist, mobile-first web app that replaces anxious scrolling with moments of shared calm.

Users scroll through 9 daily sound-based practices, each a “portal” of ambient calm.
They can join a practice, listen for a few minutes, and sense collective presence through a live counter (“145 humans here”).

🩵 Tone: soft, grounding, slightly mystical
🌅 Design: spacious, minimal, sunrise-inspired palette

TYPOGRAPHY
- Wordmark: Hanken Grotesk (semibold or medium), tracking-tight.
- Tagline: Actay Wide Regular (not bold). If Actay Wide not available, load via @font-face or use a close fallback (e.g., "system-ui" temporarily) but keep class hooks for easy swap.
- Sizes (on ~390px width): wordmark ~26–28px; tagline ~18–20px; tighten line-height (leading-tight).

BRAND COLORS
- #1e2d2e (dark green), #fcf8f2 (beige), #94d1c4 (mint), #ffaf42 (orange), #bdb2cd (lavender).
- Logo + text color: dark green #1e2d2e for strong contrast on mint.

ANIMATION (Framer Motion)
- On mount:
  • Blocks fade in together (duration 0.4s).
  • Logo group: fade-in + rise 8px (0.5–0.6s).
  • Tagline appears 200ms after logo with a soft fade (0.35–0.4s).
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion: if true, render static (no motion).

INTERACTION
- Optional “Entrar” button (rounded-2xl, dark green background, beige text) under tagline; subtle shadow-sm; tap area ≥ 44px high.
- Auto-continue to the feed after 2.5s if no action.
- On tap or after timeout, crossfade to /feed (keep splash silent).

ACCESSIBILITY
- Sufficient color contrast (tagline/wordmark on mint).
- aria-labels for the button; semantic heading for the wordmark.
- Safe area insets: use padding-top/bottom env(safe-area-inset-*).
