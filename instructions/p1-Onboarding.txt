    DELIVERABLES
- `components/SplashScreen.tsx` (React + Tailwind + Framer Motion)
- `app/page.tsx` renders `<SplashScreen />` and navigates to `/feed` on CTA or timeout.

CODE NOTES
- Equal thirds with Tailwind: `h-screen grid grid-rows-3`.
- Center mint content: wrap middle cell with `relative` + `flex items-center justify-center`.
- Keep layout at 60fps (no layout shift); no external CSS other than Tailwind.
- Mobile-first: ensure all spacing and type scales are tuned for 390×844 first.
