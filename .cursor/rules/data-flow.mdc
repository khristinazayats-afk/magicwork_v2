# data-flow

Key Data Flow Components:

1. Practice Session Flow (75/100)
src/components/ProfileScreen.jsx -> src/utils/weeklyTracking.js -> src/utils/vibeSystem.js
- Session data flows from active practice to weekly aggregation
- Practice minutes and completion status update vibe calculations
- Real-time emotional state updates trigger vibe level transitions
- Session metrics flow into achievement tracking system

2. Emotional State Tracking (85/100)
src/utils/vibeSystem.js -> mobile-app/lib/services/ai_practice_generator.dart
- Emotional check-in data (1-5 scale) flows to practice generation
- Current emotional state influences content selection
- Vibe levels affect practice pacing and narrative tone
- Historical emotional data feeds personalization engine

3. Community Presence Pipeline (80/100)
src/components/TunesFeed.jsx -> src/components/Shareouts.jsx
- Real-time practice session data flows to presence counter
- Active participant metrics update community dashboards
- Practice duration tracking feeds milestone calculations
- Privacy settings control shareout data visibility

4. Content Delivery Flow (70/100)
mobile-app/lib/services/audio_orchestration_service.dart -> mobile-app/lib/screens/practice_personalization_screen.dart
- Space-specific content selection flows to audio engine
- Background sound layers combine with narrative content
- Practice parameters determine content sequencing
- Emotional state influences content delivery timing

Core Data Integration Points:
- Emotional state -> Practice generation
- Session metrics -> Vibe calculation
- Presence data -> Community features
- User preferences -> Content delivery

Primary Data Flow Paths:

1. Practice Session Generation Pipeline (Importance: 90)
```
Emotional State Assessment -> Intent Selection -> Practice Configuration -> AI Content Generation -> Audio Orchestration
```
- Tracks user emotional state data through multi-step meditation creation
- Feeds assessment results into personalized content generation
- Coordinates parallel flows of meditation script and audio content

2. Emotional State Tracking System (Importance: 85)
```
User Input -> State Assessment -> Practice Personalization -> Analytics
```
- Five-level emotional assessment scale data propagation
- Contextual state mapping to practice parameters
- Emotional trend analysis for practice adaptation

3. Real-time Presence System (Importance: 80)
```
Session Timer -> Presence Tracking -> Community Status -> Analytics
```
- Continuous presence second calculation
- Space-specific practice duration tracking
- Community presence state broadcasting
- Streak preservation data management

4. Progress Tracking Pipeline (Importance: 75)
```
Practice Completion -> Achievement System -> Light Points -> Monthly Tiers
```
- Multi-dimensional progress data aggregation
- Cross-component milestone tracking
- Tiered progression state management

5. Community Interaction Flow (Importance: 70)
```
Practice Results -> Privacy Filter -> Space Rules -> Community Feed
```
- Privacy-aware data sharing pipeline
- Space-specific visibility rules
- Anonymous/public state management
