# animation-system

The animation system implements specialized meditation and breathwork visualization patterns:

1. Boomerang Animation System
File: src/components/animations/BoomerangAnimation.jsx
Importance Score: 85
- Custom particle system for physiological sigh pattern visualization 
- Curved trajectory calculations mapping to breathwork cycles
- Organic particle dispersion algorithms for breath flow representation
- Real-time breathing guide animations with variable pacing

2. Breathwork Design Lab
File: src/components/animations/BoomerangLab.jsx
Importance Score: 80
- Design tool for creating custom breathwork animations
- Schematic pattern generator for physiological sigh sequences
- Frame capture system for breathing pattern export
- Real-time preview and tuning for breathing guidance

Core Animation Patterns:
- Physiological sigh visualization (4-7-8 breathing)
- Particle-based breath flow representation
- Curved breathing guide trajectories
- Variable-pace meditation timing

The system focuses on translating breathing patterns and meditation states into visual guidance through particle systems and curved trajectories. Each animation pattern corresponds to specific breathing techniques and meditation practices.

Key Animation Components:

1. Boomerang Trajectory System
Path: `src/components/animations/BoomerangAnimation.jsx`
- Custom particle-based animation implementing meditative curved trajectories
- Animation timing synchronized with breathing patterns
- Particle dispersion patterns tuned for relaxation effects
Importance Score: 85

2. Nervous System Visualization 
Path: `src/components/animations/QuietGround.jsx`
- Multi-layered organic movement patterns representing physiological states
- Synchronized breathing visualization components
- Visual metaphors for soil, seeds, sprouts and mycelium growth
Importance Score: 70

Core Domain Features:
- Meditation-optimized animation timing
- Bio-inspired movement patterns
- Breathing synchronization
- Nervous system state visualization

The animation system focuses exclusively on creating visual representations that support meditative states and physiological regulation. Each component uses specialized timing and movement patterns designed to facilitate relaxation and mindfulness practices.
