# animation-system

The animation system implements specialized meditation and breathwork visualization patterns:

1. Boomerang Animation System
File: src/components/animations/BoomerangAnimation.jsx
Importance Score: 85
- Custom particle system for physiological sigh pattern visualization 
- Curved trajectory calculations mapping to breathwork cycles
- Organic particle dispersion algorithms for breath flow representation
- Real-time breathing guide animations with variable pacing

2. Breathwork Design Lab
File: src/components/animations/BoomerangLab.jsx
Importance Score: 80
- Design tool for creating custom breathwork animations
- Schematic pattern generator for physiological sigh sequences
- Frame capture system for breathing pattern export
- Real-time preview and tuning for breathing guidance

Core Animation Patterns:
- Physiological sigh visualization (4-7-8 breathing)
- Particle-based breath flow representation
- Curved breathing guide trajectories
- Variable-pace meditation timing

The system focuses on translating breathing patterns and meditation states into visual guidance through particle systems and curved trajectories. Each animation pattern corresponds to specific breathing techniques and meditation practices.

## Particle Animation Components

### Boomerang Animation System (src/components/animations/BoomerangAnimation.jsx)
Implements curved trajectory calculations with parametric equations for meditation flow visualization
- Custom particle emission based on practice state 
- Curved path generation with controlled dispersion
- Color distribution mapping to practice intensity
Importance Score: 70/100

### Quiet Ground Visualization (src/components/animations/QuietGround.jsx)
Meditation-specific nature-inspired animation patterns
- Organic growth patterns reflecting practice depth
- Visual feedback synchronized with breathing rhythm
- Element transformations based on practice states
Importance Score: 65/100

## Core Animation Patterns

1. Physiological Sigh Visualization
- Two-phase breathing pattern animation
- Extended inhale followed by double-exhale sequence
- Visual pace adjustment based on anxiety levels

2. Practice State Transitions
- Smooth morphing between meditation phases
- Particle density changes reflecting depth
- Color schemes mapped to practice types

3. Breathing Synchronization
- Real-time breath cycle visualization
- Adaptive pacing based on practice type
- Visual metronome for guided breathing

## Integration Points

- Particle systems respond to practice completion events
- Animation state management tied to meditation flow
- Visual feedback synchronized with audio narration
- Transition effects coordinated with practice milestones

The animation system focuses on therapeutic visualization patterns specifically designed for meditation guidance and breathing regulation.
