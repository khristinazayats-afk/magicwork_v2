# animation-system

The animation system implements specialized meditation and breathwork visualization patterns:

1. Boomerang Animation System
File: src/components/animations/BoomerangAnimation.jsx
Importance Score: 85
- Custom particle system for physiological sigh pattern visualization 
- Curved trajectory calculations mapping to breathwork cycles
- Organic particle dispersion algorithms for breath flow representation
- Real-time breathing guide animations with variable pacing

2. Breathwork Design Lab
File: src/components/animations/BoomerangLab.jsx
Importance Score: 80
- Design tool for creating custom breathwork animations
- Schematic pattern generator for physiological sigh sequences
- Frame capture system for breathing pattern export
- Real-time preview and tuning for breathing guidance

Core Animation Patterns:
- Physiological sigh visualization (4-7-8 breathing)
- Particle-based breath flow representation
- Curved breathing guide trajectories
- Variable-pace meditation timing

The system focuses on translating breathing patterns and meditation states into visual guidance through particle systems and curved trajectories. Each animation pattern corresponds to specific breathing techniques and meditation practices.

# animation-system

The animation system implements specialized meditation-specific visualizations and particle behaviors:

## Boomerang Animation Controller
Path: src/components/animations/BoomerangAnimation.jsx
Importance Score: 85

Core meditation guidance system:
- Synchronized particle movement for breathing pattern visualization
- Parametric curve calculations matching physiological breathing rhythms
- Dynamic color transitions based on user's emotional state
- Special handling for physiological sigh patterns (double-inhale)
- Adaptive speed control based on practice type

## Particle Flow System
Path: src/utils/animation/particleFlow.js 
Importance Score: 75

Meditation-specific particle behavior:
- Guided breathing visualization with acceleration/deceleration curves
- Practice-state aware particle emission patterns
- Special formations for different meditation techniques
- Color palette management tied to emotional states

## Animation Synchronization
Path: src/components/animations/AnimationOrchestrator.jsx
Importance Score: 70

Coordinates multiple animation subsystems:
- Voice narration timing integration
- Practice phase transitions (opening, main, closing)
- Ambient sound synchronization
- Breathing guidance timing management

The system focuses heavily on scientifically-backed breathing patterns and physiological sigh implementations, with particular attention to smooth transitions and calming visual metaphors.
